# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils



 Total Summary


  Lot Summary



### Analysis: 
#### For the total summary, the variance is at *62.3 psi*, which is under *100 psi*. This means that generally, the MechaCar prototypes meets the criteria design specifications for suspension coils. However, looking at each individually, Lot 3 has exceeded the *100 psi* design specification. In other words, some vehicles manufactured have not met the standard for suspension coils.

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

### Statistical Analysis Tool to be Used
#### For this statiscal study, I would like to use **Two-Way ANOVA** since I would be testing multiple variables.

### Data Needed
#### The data that will be collected will be coming from [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars-car-reliability-guide/) reliability ratings data and [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings) safety ratings data.
